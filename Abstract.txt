Abstract
	
Divided the IRIS and 20NEWSGROUPS datasets into clusters using the K-Means algorithm.
The precision, recall and overall F-measure for each cluster is calculated to measure cluster validity.
The overall precision and recall for the clustering is calculated by taking the maximum of the same from each cluster in the clustering.


Inputs taken by program:
	
1. Number of clusters to be generated.
	
2. Number of iterations to be run for the program.


Output of the program:
	
1. The matrix which depicts the relations between points,clusters and classes.
	
2. The final centroid points as a vector.
	
3. Precision, recall and F-measure for each cluster and the overall clustering.



Note : Since 20 Newsgroups is a huge dataset, we ran our code for 15 newsgroups and we have added that output in this folder.
